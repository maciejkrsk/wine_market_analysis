# Wine market analysis

## Description
We have been asked to create a market analysis based on data provided by Vivino, in order to do that, we needed to retrieve information from from Vivino's database and execute some tasks<br>

## Tasks
- What are the wines to highlight to increase Vivino's sales
- Limited budget, which country to prioritize
- Best winery prize
- Which wines contains a given taste
- Most common grapes worldwide
- Countries leaderboard with & without vintages
- Wines recommendations based on client's preferences
- General recommendations to improve the data provided


## Installation DIY
- Clone the git repository.
- Import all the necessary components from the file "requirements.txt".
- Run streamlit_app.py using command prompt and typing "streamlit run streamlit_app.py".
- Navigate through the web browser that will open from the previous step.

## Main tools
- Jupyter Notebook
- Streamlit
- Matplotlib

## Issues faced
- Finding a way to create visuals without using Pandas library
- Make SQL requests actually work in Jupyter Notebook, by the end of this project, I've learnt two ways of working with SQL requests : 
    <ol>
    - SQLAlchemy in Jupyter Notebook<br>
    - Sqlite3 in a .py file</ol>
    
- Trying to learn and figure out how Streamlit works and how to make use of it
